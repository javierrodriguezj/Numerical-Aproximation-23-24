# Numerical Approximation 23/24

Numerical Approximation was a subject attended on the math faculty of Universitat de Val√®ncia during 2023/24 school year.I really enjoyed it and since we mainly worked in Matlab I decided to write a jupyter notebook so it can be seen easier the main points we studied.

4. Extra: Universal Approximation Theorem

The Universal Approximation Theorem's approach given in this notebook is based on the fact that the family of neural networks is dense in the function space. For more details check the notebook.
